THE reference/docs/image-templates DIRECTORY

This directory contains image templates useful to developers 
working on Sakai or Sakai tools or for institutions creating 
their own institutionally branded Sakai skin.

Please put each tool or collection of tools for a specific task 
into a well-named directory and add your directory name below.

DOCUMENTATION

A good start for developers interested in working with Sakai is the wiki
space named "Programmer's Cafe," where many tutorials and tips have
been collected by community developers.

	http://bugs.sakaiproject.org/confluence/display/BOOT/Home

Technical documentation and white papers can be found in the architecture/
directory.

The Sakaipedia is also a good place to search for nuggets of 
insight into particular questions.

collab server, and the Confluence wiki already linked to here a
number of times (bugs.sakaiproject.org/confluence).
