			<h4>Description</h4>
			<p>
				You can copy a file from your local system to your My Workspace or site Resources using the Add button
				in the Resources tool. If you want to copy several files or an entire folder all at once, software called WebDAV
				can be used to drag files or folders from your local computer to or from the site Resources folders.
			</p>
			<p>
				Several setup steps are required to make your computer treat the site Resources folder
				as another folder on your computer. Once you have set up a particular course or project resource folder using
				WebDAV, you can drag files and folders to the course or project Resource area from your local computer and vice versa.
				Please note that these connections are specific to the computer you are using, so if you change computers you will
				have to set up the connection again.
			</p>

			<h4>Setting up your WebLearn WebDAV account</h4>
			<p>
			How you connect using WebDAV, depends on how you login to WebLearn:
			<ul>
			  <li><strong>Oxford Account</strong></>: If you login via the <em>Oxford Account</em> link, i.e. you have an Oxford (WebAuth) account, then you can use the same
			  user name and password in order to connect via WebDAV.</li>
			  <li><strong>Other Users</strong></>: If you login via the <em>Other Users</em> link, you can use the same user name and password to 
			  connect via WebDAV. If this takes the form of an e-mail address and appears not to work, then you should follow
			  the procedure described below to get a new user name that consists of just alphanumeric characters.
			  <p> 
			    <ul style="font-size: smaller">
				<li></>E-mail <a href="mailto:weblearn@oucs.ox.ac.uk">weblearn@oucs.ox.ac.uk</a> and request a user name for 
				the purposes of using WebDAV. Include your current user name in the e-mail (your new WebDAV user name will be 
				based on this). If you have a non-Oxford e-mail address, i.e. one that doesn't end in .ox.ac.uk, then include this in the
				e-mail and we will associate this with the user name. This is optional, but if for any reason you forgot your password, you
				would be able to reset it yourself rather than have to ask us to do it for you. Once this new user name has been created, 
				you can add it as a participant to the site in the <code>maintain</code> role.</li> 			
				</ul>
			  </p>	
			  </li>
			</ul>			
			</p>

			<h4>Setting up WebDAV for Windows XP</h4>
			<p>
				Note: There must be at least one object (file, folder etc.) in the course or project resource area before you begin the
				setup procedure. This procedure needs to be done once for each site before you can use WebDAV to transfer
				files to and from any one site.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Double-click on the My Network Places icon on your PC desktop to open the Network Places folder</li>
				<li>Double-click on the Add Network Place icon</li>
				<li>Click Next</li>

				<li>Click on the bottom choice: &quot;Choose another network location&quot;</li>
				<li>Click Next</li>
				<li>
					In the &quot;Internet or network address&quot; field, type the URL for this site shown above.<br />
					<img src="netwkplace.jpg" width="423" height="345" style="clear:both;display:block;margin:1em 0 " alt="" />
				</li>
				<li>
					Click Next<br />
					Note: If you receive an alert such as &quot;The folder you've entered does not appear to be valid,&quot;
					it could be there are no resources yet in your site. Go to the site and add a file to initialize the Resources
					folder, then return to Step 1.
				</li>
				<li>When asked for your username and password, enter your WebLearn username and your password</li>
				<li>
					Enter a name for the course or project resources you are adding. This name is used on your computer when
					referencing the course or project resource folder.
					<img src="name.jpg" width="423" height="345" alt="" style="clear:both;display:block;margin:1em 0" />
				</li>
				<li>Click &quot;Finish&quot; to complete the set up.</li>
				<li>
					When the setup is complete, the course or project resources folder will appear in your My Network Places as a folder.
					It will also show up under My Network Places in Windows Explorer, where it will act just like any other folder
					in Windows Explorer.
				</li>
				<li>You can now drag files and folders to and from your computer and the site Resources folder.</li>
			</ol>

			<h4>Setting up WebDAV for Windows Vista</h4>
			<p>
				Note 1: There must be at least one object (file, folder etc.) in the course or project resource area before you begin the
				setup procedure. This procedure needs to be done once for each site before you can use WebDAV to transfer
				files to and from any one site.
			</p>
			<p>
				Note 2: There are a number of known issues with support for WebDAV in Windows Vista. You may therefore experience difficulties using WebDAV as described below.
However, Microsoft has a software update available that may help correct
connection problems for some users. For information about the update
and how to download it, see article 907306 in the Microsoft knowledge
base at <span class="example"><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">http://support.microsoft.com/</a></span>.
